## Task for HyperionDev Data Science

### Project Description:

The Python script offers two financial calculators: one for calculating the interest earned on an investment and another for estimating monthly bond repayments. Upon execution, the user is prompted to select either **"investment"** or **"bond"** from the menu. Based on their selection, they are guided through the relevant calculations.

### Features:

1. #### Investment Calculator:
- Users input the initial investment amount, expected interest rate, and investment period in years.
- They can choose between simple or compound interest calculations.
- The program calculates and displays the total amount at the end of the investment period.

2. #### Bond Calculator:
- Users provide the current price of the house, the annual interest rate for the bond, and the number of monthly installments.
- The script calculates and displays the total monthly repayment amount for the bond.

### Usage:
1. Run the script.
2. Select either "investment" or "bond" as per your calculation requirement.
3. Follow the prompts to input necessary details.
4. Obtain the calculated results.

### Note:
- Ensures correct input formats (e.g., numerical values without commas for monetary amounts).
- The program will continue running until terminated by the user.
- It handles common input errors, prompts users to re-enter incorrect information.
